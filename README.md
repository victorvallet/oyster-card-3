This is our week 2 Makers challenge, do be worked on during afternoon pairing sessions.

I'm hoping to build ont he skills learned in week 1, and use TDD to build the program, with particular focus on learning how to:

Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
